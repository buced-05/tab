# Chart the performance of S\&P 500 sectors most exposed to tariffs and compare recovery paths post-April 2025

Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information to write the final report. Let me create the answer:

# S\&P 500 Sector Performance: Tariff Impact and Recovery Trajectories Post-April 2025

The April 2025 tariff shock triggered the most significant market correction since the pandemic, with the S\&P 500 plummeting 11.5% in just one week following President Trump's sweeping trade policy announcement on April 2. However, the subsequent seven-month recovery has revealed stark divergences among sectors most exposed to tariff pressures, with **Technology surging 64% from its April 8 low while Materials managed only a 15% rebound**—a 49-percentage-point performance gap that underscores fundamental differences in sector resilience, supply chain adaptability, and exposure to secular growth trends.

![Recovery paths of tariff-exposed S\&P 500 sectors from April 8 low through November 5, 2025, showing Technology's 64% recovery significantly outpacing Materials' 15% gain.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/6db59cf0ade6cff0257e00a7f959f2cc/b635c973-c08d-4e9b-ab15-b2d48a335ce1/26e0b365.png)

Recovery paths of tariff-exposed S\&P 500 sectors from April 8 low through November 5, 2025, showing Technology's 64% recovery significantly outpacing Materials' 15% gain.

## The April 2025 Tariff Shock: Universal Pain, Differential Impact

On April 2, 2025, the Trump administration announced the most comprehensive tariff regime in nearly a century, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports, 25% levies on automobiles and auto parts, and an unprecedented 145% tariff on Chinese goods (later reduced following negotiations). The immediate market response was catastrophic: \$6.6 trillion in market value evaporated within 48 hours, and the S\&P 500 briefly entered bear market territory with an intraday decline of 21.35% from its February 19 peak.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4]

The four sectors most exposed to tariff pressures—Materials, Technology, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary—experienced nearly identical initial selloffs on April 8, 2025. **Materials (XLB) declined 13.94%, Technology (XLK) fell 13.59%, Industrials (XLI) dropped 11.68%, and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) decreased 11.62%**. This uniform collapse reflected market participants' interpretation that tariffs would generate both direct cost pressures and indirect demand destruction across the economy.[^1_5][^1_6][^1_7]

The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's analysis confirmed that investors perceived the tariff announcement as likely to reduce corporate profits over the longer term in both the United States and other countries, with elevated financial risk signaling higher probability of an economic slowdown. Sectors with indirect trade exposure—particularly Financials and Real Estate—also underperformed significantly despite minimal direct tariff impact, suggesting widespread concern about macroeconomic deterioration.[^1_6]

## Divergent Recovery Paths: Technology Decouples from Industrial Sectors

The recovery trajectories from the April 8 low point have been dramatically uneven, revealing fundamental differences in sector characteristics that transcend simple tariff exposure calculations. By November 5, 2025, **Technology had surged 64.19% from its low, Consumer Discretionary gained 36.70%, Industrials rose 31.59%, while Materials lagged with only 14.74% growth**—underperforming even the S\&P 500 benchmark's 36.48% recovery.[^1_5]

### Technology's Exceptional Resilience

Technology's outperformance stems from three critical factors that insulated the sector from the worst tariff impacts while positioning it to capitalize on continued secular growth trends.[^1_8][^1_9]

**First, semiconductor and electronics exemptions provided immediate relief.** On April 11, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum exempting specific electronic goods—including semiconductors, computers, and related components—from reciprocal tariffs. This exemption, covering an astonishing \$34 billion of imports per month, proved essential for the continued AI infrastructure buildout. Imports of large computers commonly found in data centers exceeded \$235 billion annualized by mid-2025, up 227% compared to pre-ChatGPT levels. Without this carve-out, importers would have paid an extra \$19.2 billion in tariffs through October 2025.[^1_10][^1_11][^1_12]

**Second, AI demand remained structurally intact despite macro uncertainty.** The global race to build sovereign AI capabilities intensified rather than diminished following the tariff announcement, as governments viewed AI infrastructure as a national priority regardless of trade tensions. The fastest quarterly growth in AI and intellectual property investment in four years occurred in Q2 2025, with capital flowing into automation, predictive maintenance, and analytics. Technology companies benefited from premium pricing power and rapidly adapting supply chains, with firms like Jabil demonstrating willingness to absorb higher manufacturing costs in Mexico rather than relocate production.[^1_9][^1_13]

**Third, the sector's high gross margins provided buffer capacity.** S\&P 500 companies entered the tariff period with gross margins at historical highs of 34.4%, substantially above MSCI Europe (28.4%) and Japan (27.2%). Technology's strongest players—concentrated in software, cloud services, and AI infrastructure—maintained pricing power even as consumer demand softened elsewhere. KPMG's May 2025 survey of technology executives found that 28% reported virtually no change in gross margins despite tariff pressures, with another 28% citing only modest 1-5% declines.[^1_14][^1_8][^1_9]

Technology recovered to pre-tariff levels (April 1 price) within just 17 trading days—by April 25, 2025—the fastest recovery among all sectors analyzed.[^1_5]

### Materials: Trapped by Commodity Cycle Dynamics

Materials' dramatic underperformance reflects the sector's exposure to a perfect storm of negative factors: direct tariff costs, collapsing commodity demand, and structural overcapacity in key markets.[^1_15][^1_16][^1_17]

**Tariff costs hit Materials hardest.** Primary metals manufacturing—encompassing steel, aluminum, and copper smelting—faced additional input costs exceeding 12% under the commodity-specific tariffs, with broad 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports implemented in March 2025. Unlike Technology, Materials sectors received no meaningful exemptions, and the sector's low value-added nature provided limited pricing power to pass costs to customers.[^1_18][^1_19][^1_20]

**Commodity prices collapsed on demand fears.** Between April 2 and April 8, copper prices plunged 11%, while Brent crude oil dropped \$12 per barrel—the 11th-worst four-day performance since 1990. The World Bank's April 2025 Commodity Markets Outlook projected commodity prices would fall 12% in 2025 as weakening global economic growth weighed on demand, with industrial metals particularly vulnerable. Copper prices were forecast to decline 19% year-over-year in a downside scenario incorporating sharper trade-war impacts.[^1_15]

**China's economic slowdown compounded pressures.** As the world's largest industrial economy and outsized consumer of steel, copper, chemicals, and construction materials, China's flagging consumer demand and property market downturn devastated Materials sector fundamentals. Chemical producers faced both weak demand from tariff-related economic slowdown and global oversupply due to Chinese overcapacity. Production levels fell below the trailing 10-year average as facilities shut down in Europe and Asia (except China), with growth projects in North America delayed.[^1_16][^1_17]

Materials remains the only tariff-exposed sector that has not yet recovered to April 1 price levels, trading 1.25% below its pre-tariff benchmark as of November 5, 2025. The sector's current underperformance versus the S\&P 500 stands at 21.73 percentage points—the widest divergence among major sectors.[^1_5]

### Industrials and Consumer Discretionary: Middle-Ground Recovery

Industrials and Consumer Discretionary demonstrated intermediate recovery patterns, outpacing Materials but trailing Technology's exceptional performance.[^1_5]

**Industrials (XLI) gained 31.59% from its April low**, recovering to pre-tariff levels by May 1 (23 trading days). The sector benefited from infrastructure spending offsets and accelerating reshoring trends, even as direct tariff exposure on transportation equipment, machinery, and fabricated metals created headwinds. Companies with significant automotive supply chain exposure faced particular challenges, as the 25% auto tariff substantially impacted transportation equipment manufacturers. However, sectors like aerospace and defense saw robust demand from increased defense spending budgets.[^1_20][^1_9][^1_5]

**Consumer Discretionary (XLY) rose 36.70%**, recovering to April 1 levels by May 2 (24 trading days). The sector's performance was bifurcated: domestically-focused retailers and services companies thrived, while apparel, footwear, and home goods retailers with heavy import dependence struggled. Companies like VF Corporation (The North Face, Vans, Timberland) saw stock prices decline 30% due to strong reliance on China and Vietnam suppliers. However, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Tesla drove significant gains, with Tesla up 29.7% versus traditional automakers. Consumer Discretionary nearly matched the S\&P 500 benchmark recovery, outperforming by just 0.23 percentage points as of November 5.[^1_1][^1_18][^1_5]

## Macroeconomic Context and Policy Evolution

The tariff regime's evolution significantly influenced sector recovery paths. Following the April 9 announcement of a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most nations (excluding Mexico, Canada, and China), market volatility contracted dramatically and investor sentiment improved. By June 30, 2025, equity markets had rebounded sharply as tariff threats de-escalated and constructive trade discussions progressed, with many indices reaching new all-time highs by summer.[^1_2][^1_4]

The effective tariff rate peaked at 28% immediately following the April announcements—the highest since 1901—but consumption shifts reduced the post-substitution rate to 18%, still the highest since 1934. These tariffs raised an estimated \$2.5 trillion over the 2026-35 budget window, though slower economic growth reduced net dynamic revenue to \$2.0 trillion.[^1_21][^1_4]

The economic impact proved substantial but contained. The Budget Lab at Yale estimated US real GDP growth declined by 0.5 percentage points in both 2025 and 2026 due to tariffs, with the economy persistently 0.4% smaller in the long run—equivalent to \$125 billion annually. The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage points by end-2025 and 0.7 percentage points by end-2026, with payroll employment 490,000 lower than baseline projections. However, these impacts fell short of recession-level disruption, allowing the recovery to proceed.[^1_21]

## Sector Rotation and Investment Implications

The differential recovery patterns created significant sector rotation opportunities for investors who recognized the structural factors driving divergence. From the April 8 bottom through November 5, Technology accounted for approximately 45% of global equity market gains, with the sector bouncing 47% globally.[^1_5][^1_22]

**Valuation resets created entry points.** Technology valuations compressed substantially during the correction, with many names de-rating to attractive levels despite ongoing AI secular growth trends. The reset provided longer-term investors favorable entry points, particularly in areas trading below historical averages when adjusting for growth prospects and balance sheet strength.[^1_9]

**Quality and resilience commanded premiums.** The tariff shock reinforced the importance of balance sheet strength, cash flow generation, and pricing power. Companies with scale, profitability, and fortress balance sheets demonstrated superior resilience versus smaller, more cyclical peers. This flight to quality particularly benefited mega-cap Technology names.[^1_9]

**Cyclical exposure became a liability.** Sectors and companies with high operational leverage to economic growth faced persistent headwinds even as the immediate tariff panic subsided. Materials, with its combination of high fixed costs and commodity price sensitivity, remained structurally challenged throughout the recovery period.[^1_18][^1_17]

## Long-Term Structural Implications

The April 2025 tariff shock and subsequent recovery revealed enduring structural shifts that will likely influence sector dynamics for years to come.[^1_21][^1_20][^1_8]

**Supply chain restructuring accelerated.** Companies dramatically fast-tracked supply chain diversification efforts, with technology firms leading the way in establishing resilient multi-country sourcing networks. Manufacturing began reallocating away from China toward Mexico, Southeast Asia, and domestic production, though these transitions require years to complete.[^1_8][^1_9]

**AI investments became geopolitically essential.** The tariff war reinforced rather than diminished commitments to sovereign AI capabilities, with governments viewing AI infrastructure as strategically non-negotiable. This provided Technology with a secular growth pillar insulated from trade policy volatility.[^1_9]

**Sectoral GDP reallocation favored manufacturing over materials.** In the long run, tariffs drove US manufacturing output to expand by 2.5%, with non-advanced durable manufacturing up 4.5%. However, these gains more than crowded out other sectors: construction contracted 3.8%, agriculture declined 0.3%, and mining fell 1.6%. This reallocation disadvantaged Materials producers serving these declining end markets.[^1_21]

**Commodity markets entered extended weakness.** The combination of tariff-induced demand destruction and Chinese overcapacity positioned commodity prices for multi-year weakness. The World Bank projected commodity prices would decline another 5% in 2026, reaching a six-year low. For Materials investors, this implied persistently challenged fundamentals beyond the immediate recovery period.[^1_15][^1_17]

## Conclusion

The S\&P 500 sector performance divergence following April 2025's tariff shock illustrates how initial market stress tests reveal underlying structural resilience. While all tariff-exposed sectors crashed together—with declines of 11-14% in one week—the subsequent seven-month recovery exposed fundamental differences in adaptability, end-market strength, and secular positioning.[^1_5][^1_6]

Technology's 64% rebound from its April 8 low, driven by semiconductor exemptions, intact AI demand, and strong balance sheets, stands in stark contrast to Materials' 15% gain, which was constrained by direct tariff costs, commodity price collapses, and Chinese demand weakness. This 49-percentage-point performance gap demonstrates that tariff exposure alone inadequately predicts recovery outcomes—sector-specific factors including pricing power, supply chain flexibility, regulatory treatment, and end-market resilience proved equally critical.[^1_8][^1_15][^1_9][^1_17][^1_5]

As tariff policies continue evolving through legal challenges and ongoing negotiations, investors should recognize that initial panic selling creates opportunities in sectors with structural growth drivers and operational resilience, while commodity-exposed cyclicals may face extended headwinds even as broader markets recover. The April 2025 experience provides a valuable template for analyzing future trade policy shocks: look beyond headline tariff rates to examine exemption patterns, secular demand trends, balance sheet strength, and supply chain adaptability when assessing likely recovery trajectories.[^1_23][^1_9]
